# Learners

Learners is a web framework originally built by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) to facilitate training courses, with a specific focus on information and computer security.

It provides participants with a unified interface to access presentations, workbooks, cyber range environments, quizzes, and supporting tools. Instructors can easily manage the learning environment and monitor progress.

Learners is specifically designed to operate with minimal infrastructure requirements and without any associated software costs. This enables the seamless creation, sharing, remixing, and delivery of training courses on a wide scale.

This is the `learners-application` repository, the main learners repository is located [here](https://github.com/iaeaorg/learners).

The Learners theme is based on [hugo-theme-learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn).
